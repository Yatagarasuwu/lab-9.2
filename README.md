# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

The main goal of this lab was to create an entity/evil being called the "EvilCircle" that would take over the provided JS project showing colorful circles, making it a "game" of sorts where the user would try to move into all the colorful circles shown. There is now a counter for how many circles are on the screen, too.

## Sources and Credits
HEAVY use of w3schools JavaScript: https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp. For example below I checked JS Constructors (for the beginning), syntax, ArrowFunction (was thinking movement, still checked it so its here), JS Arrays, (for the Ball, thought I needed it more) and this Keyword.

- Obviously, I used the provided resources you gave us both in the lab and the README. The lab's code is integrated, and I used:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Advanced_JavaScript_objects/Classes_in_JavaScript
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Drawing_graphics

  Finally:
- Usage of Integrated CoPilot to figure out errors within code, such as why I couldn't use Math.abs for my EvilCircle's checkBounds().
